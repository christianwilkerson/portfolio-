                    <p>I am a software developer based out of Boston, MA. As this a career change for me, I am mostly looking forward too: </p>

                        <h3>About Me</h3>
                            <p class="first-p">A few passions of mine are playing basketball and day trading/investing in the foreign exchange and crypto-currency markets!</p>
                            <p>After stumbling upon the lifestyle, salary, and the creativity of what one can produce being a software developer, a light bulb went off and I had to pursue the calling. 
                            With being a young millienial/Gen Z affilate, technology is often everywhere and anywhere. 
                            Being able to potentially contribute towards projects that push the technologic age forward past previous heights is one of the many driving factors for myself to join the Thinkful bootcamp and community! </p>
